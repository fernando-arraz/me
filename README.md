Hi, my name is Carlos Fernando Arraz

I'm a mathematician, who graduated from UFBA - University Federal da Bahia, Brazil (https://ime.ufba.br/).

I have a master's degree in mathematics and computation, with a machine learning specialization from UMinho - University of Minho, Portugal (http://www.math.uminho.pt/Default.aspx?tabid=7&pageid=82&lang=pt-PT),.

Nowadays, I'm ongoing in a Ph.D. program in applied mathematics more known as MAP - PDMA, Portugal (https://map-pdma.up.pt/program/). 


# My work in Machine Learning (ML)

## Master's Thesis researches

- **[PCA_vs_t-SNE]:** The main goal is to compare a couple of techniques for dimensionality reduction for application in clustering analysis, specifically in conditions where we handle data with high dimensions (much more features than samples: $n >> p$) as gene expression for cancer recognition.
